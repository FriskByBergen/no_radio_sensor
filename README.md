# Arduino and RPi connected by USB

If the sensors are to be connected close to a power supply an Arduino and RPi can be connected by USB for transferring of data.

The sensors are as follows:

* Sharp dust sensor from DRRobot
* DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor from DFRobot
* Gas sensor V2 from DFRobot

The Arduino board is the Romeo V2.2 from DFRobot. The RPi is a standard RPi running standard Raspian OS. The Arduino and RPi are connected by USB cable.
